## **Evaluating a Learning Algorithm**  

*Deciding what to do next:*  
If your model is doing poor predictions, it can be tricky to decide which avenue pursuing.  
Usual courses of action are using more training examples, a smaller set of features, getting additional features, adding polynomial features, changing lambda.  
A simple technique to rule out some of these choices is performing a machine learning diagnostic, which will give insight on what is or is not working.  

*Evaluating a hypothesis:*
