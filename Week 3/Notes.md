## **Classification and Representation**  

*Classification:*  
  Classification problems are better resolved with a *logistic regression* algorithm.  
  An attempt at using linear regression can be made, by mapping predictions greather than 0.5 to 1 and lesser to 0 (*threshold classifier*), but this solution doesn't work very well because classification is not actually a linear function.  
  A *binary classification* problem is where y can only take 2 values.  
  For more than 2 values, we talk about *multiclass classification*.  
  
*Hypothesis representation:*
