## **Cost Function and Backpropagation**  

*Cost function:*  
Let's define some new variables:  
L := total number of layers  
sl := number of units in layer l (not counting bias unit)  
K := number of output units, =1 for binary classification & >3 for multi-class classification  
The cost function for neural networks is a generalization of the on for logistic regression:

The double sum adds up the logistic regression costs calculated for each cell in the output layer.  
The triple sum adds up the square of all individuals θ in the entire network.  
The i in the triple sum does not refer to training example i.

*Backpropagation algorithm:*  
Backpropagation is neural-network terminology for minimizing our cost function.  
The backpropagation algorithm is used to compute the partial derivative of J(θ) : ![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/SeSWDXP.jpg)
