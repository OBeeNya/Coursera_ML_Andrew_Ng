## **Motivations**  

*Non-linear hypotheses:*  
In a classification problem, an logistic regression can be used as seen before.  
But if the solution is non-linear, logistic regression will only work effectively for a small number of features.  
Computing with polynomial terms of one hundred features would be way too expensive.

*Neurons and the brain:*  
The hypothesis of the *one learning algorithm* is based on the fact that the same part of the brain tissue can execute different tasks when performing neuro-rewiring experiments.  
If we figure out the brain's algorithm, we can implement some approximation of that algorithm on a computer.

## **Neural Networks**
